# Rad_House_Wren_Analyses
This is a folder containing all of the R code used in my rad manuscript. 
Data files for each analysis are as follows (and will all be available on Dryad)
gghybrid: Takes a structure file
PCA: takes a .012 file generated by VCFTools
Mapping: Uses a file containing geographic locations, as well as a metadata file containing population level identifiers, as well as individual identifiers.
NGSAdmix and Admixture: This code is just for plotting data generated by the software NGSAdmix and ADMIXTURE. Detailed instructions on how to run those programs are available here: http://www.popgen.dk/software/index.php/NgsAdmix and here: chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://dalexander.github.io/admixture/admixture-manual.pdf
